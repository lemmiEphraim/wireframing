# Wireframing Overview

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the creation of a basic visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a website or app's user interface. It focuses on functionality and element placement, like navigation and content, without detailed styling.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is vital in the design process because it:
- **Defines Layout**: Clarifies the interface structure for designers and stakeholders.
- **Saves Time**: Enables early feedback and quick iterations before detailed design.
- **Guides Development**: Provides a clear blueprint for developers.
- **Improves UX**: Ensures a user-friendly and intuitive final product.

Wireframes are a key step to align teams and streamline design workflows.
